# FEM
FEM program for linear-static analysis

This project is part of the course of COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS OF MATERIAL for the MSc in Mechanical Engineering
Goal is to build an all-around Fem code dealing with linear-elasticity (and eventually non-linear analysis and damage simulation).
The code of the main engine is built on Python and resolve to other commercial open-source softwar for the meshing part and post-processing visualisation of results suchs as Paraview and gmsh
